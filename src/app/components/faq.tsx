    question: "What is Glow?",
    answer: "Glow is a crypto-economic protocol aimed at accelerating the transition to clean energy, particularly solar. It incentivizes the deployment of solar farms by rewarding them with cash and Glow tokens when they produce electricity. This approach aims to make solar energy economically viable where it might not be otherwise, ultimately creating an abundance of affordable clean power that can outcompete carbon-emitting energy sources."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Glow work?",
    answer: "Solar farms join Glow by contributing the present value of 10 years of their electricity revenue upfront. Glow Certification Agents audit the farms and certify carbon credits. These credits are tokenized and sold in auctions. Glow distributes its native token (GLW) and USDC rewards to solar farms based on their contributions and carbon credit production."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a carbon credit?",
    answer: "A carbon credit represents one metric ton of CO2 prevented from being emitted into the atmosphere. It's used to incentivize the reduction of global CO2 emissions."
  },
  {
    question: "Where does the demand for carbon credits come from?",
    answer: "Demand for carbon credits primarily comes from companies, organizations, and governments seeking to offset greenhouse gas emissions and meet climate targets. This includes businesses with net-zero commitments, entities demonstrating environmental responsibility, participants in compliance markets, and individuals offsetting personal carbon footprints."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Glow Carbon Credits different?",
    answer: "Glow Carbon Credits (GCC) are designed to ensure high additionality, meaning they represent emissions reductions that wouldn't have occurred without the incentive. They're also more reliable due to Glow's strict requirements and robust auditing system."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Glow token used for?",
    answer: "The Glow token (GLW) is used as a reward for protocol participants and is the required currency to acquire Glow Carbon Credits (GCC). It's distributed on a fixed inflationary schedule and is burned when used to purchase GCC."
  },
  {
    question: "Why invest in solar?",
    answer: "Solar energy is currently the world's cheapest source of clean electricity. The cost of producing solar energy has decreased by 95% since 2001, making it a cost-effective way to decrease electricity-related CO2 emissions."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I participate in Glow?",
    answer: "The primary way to participate in Glow is by deploying a solar farm specifically for the protocol. Anyone who deploys a solar farm can join Glow and compete for rewards. Visit glow.org for more information on the steps to follow to join the protocol."
